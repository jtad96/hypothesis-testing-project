These titles - Billy Madison, The Blue Lagoon, Happy Gilmore, American Pie, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, Feardotcom, and Captain America: Civil War - are highly social, ensemble-driven, or humor-based. This suggests people without siblings could engage less with group-centered or comedic plots. Platforms could use this insight for audience segmentation, promoting solo-character or introspective films to single-child viewers, and reserving social comedies for broader audiences to optimize engagement and ad targeting."

It’s pretty obvious that The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) was well-received overall, since lower ratings are rare in both groups. The overall picture doesn’t show any strong difference - both groups seem to have genuinely enjoyed the movie, and the shape of their distributions tells the same story: high ratings dominate regardless of how they watched it.

    "After running the one-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests across all movies, we found that only about 4% of movies (around 16 out of nearly 400) showed a statistically significant social effect, meaning social watchers rated those movies higher than alone watchers. The list mostly includes emotionally engaging or widely popular titles such as Finding Nemo (2003), Forrest Gump (1994), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), and several Harry Potter films - movies that are often associated with shared emotional experiences or nostalgia. This low proportion suggests that, in general, watching socially doesn’t systematically lead to higher enjoyment, but a few highly social or emotionally resonant movies might benefit from the group experience.\n",

    "After running directional Mann-Whitney U tests in both directions, we found that about 71.4% of movies (roughly 285 out of 400) showed a statistically significant “alone effect” - meaning people who prefer watching movies alone rated those films higher than social watchers. Compared to the earlier 4% that showed a social effect, this is a striking contrast. The majority of movies, therefore, seem to be better appreciated in solitary viewing contexts, perhaps because many titles-especially psychological thrillers, dramas, and introspective classics like Taxi Driver (1976), Black Swan (2010), The Exorcist (1973), and American Beauty (1999)-demand focus, reflection, or emotional depth that resonates more when experienced alone. This pattern suggests that while social watching can enhance the enjoyment of a small number of lighthearted or communal films, the vast majority of movies appear to elicit stronger individual engagement and appreciation when watched alone."

    "Both movies show a strong left-skewed distribution, meaning most viewers rated them on the higher end of the scale. However, the difference in height and shape between the bars suggests that Finding Nemo (2003) generally received higher and more consistent ratings than Home Alone (1990). The tallest bars for Finding Nemo at the 4.0 rating level show that a much larger share of people gave it top marks, while Home Alone ratings are slightly more spread between 2.0 and 3.5. The density plot reinforces this - Finding Nemo’s curve rises sharply and dominates across higher rating bins, indicating that its ratings are both more concentrated and more favorable overall. In short, both films were well liked, but Finding Nemo stands out as being more universally enjoyed and consistently rated higher.\n",

This result is statistically significant, meaning the difference in rating distributions between Home Alone (1990) and Finding Nemo (2003) is extremely unlikely to have occurred by random chance. In practical terms, this indicates that the two movies were rated in meaningfully different ways - with Finding Nemo (2003) receiving higher and more consistently positive ratings, while Home Alone (1990) shows slightly more variability and a lower overall concentration of top scores.\n",
