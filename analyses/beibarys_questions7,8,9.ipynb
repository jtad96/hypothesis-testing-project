    "These titles are mostly relationship-driven or emotionally centered films.\n",

    "- Negative δ ≤ -0.28 = Male viewers prefer these significantly more.\n",
    "- These films tend to be action, war, thrillers, or darker intensity thematic content.\n",

    "- Movies with small effect sizes (|δ| between 0.10 and 0.27) show weaker differences that, while statistically detectable, do not result in strong separation in preference. \n",

    "**Practical Value:**\n",
    "- This approach lets us move beyond just “significant vs not” and quantify relevance. Cliff's delta directly tells us how strongly preferences diverge or converge between genders. This makes it possible to translate statistical results into actionable strategies for personalization, audience segmentation, and targeted content recommendations - using non-parametric effect sizes that align with the ordinal nature of the rating scale."

Statistical significance alone does not tell us the strength of the difference - especially with large or imbalanced samples. That is why we calculated effect size.

    " - |delta| large effect around 0.43 \n",

    "Both movies show a strong left-skewed distribution, meaning most viewers rated them on the higher end of the scale. However, the difference in height and shape between the bars suggests that Finding Nemo (2003) generally received higher and more consistent ratings than Home Alone (1990). The tallest bars for Finding Nemo at the 4.0 rating level show that a much larger share of people gave it top marks, while Home Alone ratings are slightly more spread between 2.0 and 3.5. The density plot reinforces this - Finding Nemo’s curve rises sharply and dominates across higher rating bins, indicating that its ratings are both more concentrated and more favorable overall. In short, both films were well liked, but Finding Nemo stands out as being more universally enjoyed and consistently rated higher.\n",
