    "- Using Cliff's delta, we identified which movies show practically meaningful gender-based preference differences.\n",
    "- Movies with medium-to-large effect sizes (|δ| ≥ 0.28 and |δ| ≥ 0.43) show strong preference separation between genders. \n",
    "- For these films, the likelihood that one gender consistently rates the movie higher is meaningfully large - these can be leveraged in recommendation systems for audience-specific targeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- Positive δ ≥ 0.28 = Female viewers prefer these films noticeably more.\n",
    "These titles are mostly relationship-driven or emotionally centered films.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Negative δ ≤ -0.28 = Male viewers prefer these significantly more.\n",
    "- These films tend to be action, war, thrillers, or darker intensity thematic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Movies with small effect sizes (|δ| between 0.10 and 0.27) show weaker differences that, while statistically detectable, do not result in strong separation in preference. \n",
    "- These titles can be considered more universal recommendations, suitable for mixed audiences without heavy gender bias in reception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Value:**\n",
    "- This approach lets us move beyond just “significant vs not” and quantify relevance. Cliff's delta directly tells us how strongly preferences diverge or converge between genders. This makes it possible to translate statistical results into actionable strategies for personalization, audience segmentation, and targeted content recommendations - using non-parametric effect sizes that align with the ordinal nature of the rating scale."

It’s pretty obvious that The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) was well-received overall, since lower ratings are rare in both groups. The overall picture doesn’t show any strong difference - both groups seem to have genuinely enjoyed the movie, and the shape of their distributions tells the same story: high ratings dominate regardless of how they watched it. We need to test this relationship statistically. "

    "Both movies show a strong left-skewed distribution, meaning most viewers rated them on the higher end of the scale. However, the difference in height and shape between the bars suggests that Finding Nemo (2003) generally received higher and more consistent ratings than Home Alone (1990). The tallest bars for Finding Nemo at the 4.0 rating level show that a much larger share of people gave it top marks, while Home Alone ratings are slightly more spread between 2.0 and 3.5. The density plot reinforces this - Finding Nemo’s curve rises sharply and dominates across higher rating bins, indicating that its ratings are both more concentrated and more favorable overall. In short, both films were well liked, but Finding Nemo stands out as being more universally enjoyed and consistently rated higher.\n",
